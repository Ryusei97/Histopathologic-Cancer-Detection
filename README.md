# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection

Cancer detection through machine learning is crucial because it enables early, accurate diagnosis, which is often the key to successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. By analyzing diverse medical data types, machine learning can uncover subtle patterns and anomalies that may be challenging for human clinicians to detect. This repository contains a jupyter notebook for the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) dataset on Kaggle.com. It shows how to train a VGGNet model from scratch and how to transfer train a Resnet model.
